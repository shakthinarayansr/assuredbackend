# AssuredGig Backend

Platform services for the AssuredGig / AssuredCrew worker app. NestJS (Fastify) ·
TypeScript strict · Prisma · PostgreSQL 17 · Redis/Valkey + BullMQ.

Built to **Backend TRD v0.1** (`assuredgig_backend_trd_mvp.md` — not yet
committed to this repo; drop it in `docs/` so the section references below
resolve). The TRD is the reference for *why* anything here is shaped the way
it is.

## Prerequisites

- **Node 24 LTS** — pinned in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc) (v24.19.0). With nvm: `nvm use`.
- **Postgres 17 and Redis** — already installed and running locally. This machine
  has no container runtime, so rather than `docker compose up`, the services run
  from userspace binaries under `~/.local`. Manage them with
  [scripts/dev-services.sh](scripts/dev-services.sh).

```bash
./scripts/dev-services.sh start    # postgres :5432 · redis :6379
./scripts/dev-services.sh status
./scripts/dev-services.sh stop
```

Redis 7.4.2 stands in for the Valkey named in
[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml); they are protocol-compatible and BullMQ
cannot tell them apart. The compose file remains the reference for CI and
production, where containers are available.

## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.example .env             # fill in secrets; thresholds do NOT go here
npm install
./scripts/dev-services.sh start
npx prisma migrate deploy        # schema is already migrated locally
npm run db:seed                  # 24 config keys + 4 feature flags
npm run start:dev
```

- API: `http://localhost:3000/v1`
- OpenAPI: `http://localhost:3000/docs` (JSON at `/docs/openapi.json`)
- Health: `/v1/healthz`, `/v1/readyz`

`/v1` comes from URI versioning alone — **do not also call
`setGlobalPrefix('v1')`**, or every route mounts at `/v1/v1/...`. All app
configuration lives in [src/bootstrap.ts](src/bootstrap.ts), which `main.ts` and
the e2e suite both call so tests can never validate a differently-configured app.

### The seat-uniqueness index

The initial migration already carries it. When regenerating migrations from
scratch, run `prisma migrate dev --create-only` and append
[`prisma/manual/001_seat_hold_unique.sql`](prisma/manual/001_seat_hold_unique.sql)
before applying. It creates the **partial** unique index that makes "one seat,
one worker" a database invariant — Prisma cannot express a partial index in
schema, and without it concurrent acceptance of the same seat produces two
bookings. Keep that file outside `prisma/migrations/`; Prisma treats every
subdirectory there as a migration and fails with `P3015`.

## Layout

```
src/
  shared/          idempotency · geo · time arbitration · errors · guards
  config/          thresholds and flags as data (§12)
  queue/           BullMQ queues, Redis client, stable job ids (§10)
  prisma/          PrismaService
  auth/            otp, sessions, tokens, device binding (§7)
  workers/ companies/ requirements/
  bookings/        state machine + append-only event log (§5)
  attendance/      the validation pipeline (§8)
  confirmations/ reliability/ notifications/ disputes/ media/ ops/
  health/
prisma/            schema, seed, manual migration SQL
test/              e2e
```

Modules talk through services, never by reaching into each other's Prisma
models. `bookings` is the only module permitted to write booking state.

## What is implemented vs. scaffolded

**Implemented** — the correctness spine, the parts that are expensive to retrofit:

| Area | File |
|---|---|
| Error contract, stable machine codes | [src/shared/errors/](src/shared/errors/) |
| Idempotency (claim / replay / key-reuse) | [src/shared/idempotency/](src/shared/idempotency/) |
| Time arbitration + tests | [src/shared/time/](src/shared/time/) |
| Haversine geo + implied-speed signal | [src/shared/geo/geo.service.ts](src/shared/geo/geo.service.ts) |
| Booking state machine + exhaustive tests | [src/bookings/booking-state-machine.ts](src/bookings/booking-state-machine.ts) |
| Transition writer (projection + event, one transaction) | [src/bookings/bookings.service.ts](src/bookings/bookings.service.ts) |
| Attendance pipeline: 9 stages, accumulating verdicts | [src/attendance/pipeline/](src/attendance/pipeline/) |
| Config service: DB-backed, Redis-cached, audited | [src/config/config.service.ts](src/config/config.service.ts) |
| Presigned R2 uploads | [src/media/media.service.ts](src/media/media.service.ts) |
| OTP sign-in, rotating device-bound sessions | [src/auth/](src/auth/) |
| Worker profile: read, step-wise update | [src/workers/](src/workers/) |
| Full data model | [prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma) |

**Scaffolded** — module shells carrying a docblock of what belongs in them:
`companies`, `requirements`, `confirmations`, `reliability`, `notifications`,
`disputes`, `ops`. No controllers or DTOs for those yet, and no BullMQ
processors — the queues and job ids are declared in
[src/queue/queue.constants.ts](src/queue/queue.constants.ts), the processors are not written.

Two pipeline stages have `TODO` bodies that need an external decision before they
can be finished: media HEAD-check against R2, and face verification (**BT-2** —
provider choice, which also decides whether biometric data leaves the country).

### Authentication

The API is **fail-closed**. `JwtAuthGuard` and `RolesGuard` are both registered
as `APP_GUARD` in [src/auth/auth.module.ts](src/auth/auth.module.ts) and run in
that order: the first establishes identity, the second decides whether the
endpoint accepts it. A new controller is therefore protected whether or not its
author remembered to think about it, and opting out takes an explicit
`@Public()` — currently only health.

Worker sign-in is OTP over phone:

```
POST /v1/auth/otp/request   { phone }                       → public, rate-limited
POST /v1/auth/otp/verify    { phone, code, deviceId }       → public, creates the worker
POST /v1/auth/refresh       { refreshToken, deviceId }      → public, rotates
POST /v1/auth/logout                                        → worker
GET  /v1/workers/me                                         → worker
PATCH /v1/workers/me                                        → worker, @Idempotent()
```

OTP codes are stored as a **peppered HMAC**, never a plain digest: six digits is
a millon possibilities, so an unkeyed hash of a stolen table is reversible in
seconds. Refresh tokens are opaque, hashed at rest, device-bound and rotating;
presenting an already-rotated token revokes the entire family, because a replay
means the token leaked.

No MSG91 credentials exist yet, so `LoggingOtpSender` writes the code to the log
instead of sending it — and **refuses to run when `NODE_ENV=production`**, since
a silent no-op sender there would lock every worker out with no visible failure.

## Invariants worth not breaking

1. **Never trust a client verdict.** The client's geofence opinion is stored as
   a flag when it disagrees with the server; it never decides anything.
2. **Every write is idempotent.** Mark write endpoints `@Idempotent()`; the
   unique constraint, not application logic, is what makes duplicates safe.
3. **State transitions are append-only.** A status without a matching
   `BookingEvent` is a corrupt audit trail. Only `BookingsService.transition()`
   writes booking state.
4. **Server time is the only trusted clock.** Device time is evidence.
5. **No threshold is a constant.** If you are about to write a number, it
   belongs in [src/config/config-keys.ts](src/config/config-keys.ts) as a seed
   default and in the `config` table as truth.
6. **Verdict and flags are separate.** Accepted-with-three-flags is a real
   outcome, not a contradiction.

## Tests

```bash
npm test              # unit  — 17 tests
npm run test:e2e      # e2e   — 22 tests; needs services running
```

The concurrency tests named in TRD §15 — one seat under concurrent acceptance,
duplicate check-in submission, offline check-in landing at capture time, no-show
firing exactly once — are **not yet written**. They are the tests that protect
the reliability data from irrecoverable corruption; write them alongside the
endpoints they cover.
